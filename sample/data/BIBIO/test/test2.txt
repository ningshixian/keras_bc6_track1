Remarkably , the orientation of B^PR^I - 924 and its analogue 18 ( B^P3^I - d - B^Ala^I and 3 - methyl - 1H - indene B^cap^I ) in the hβ5c / hβ6 chimera ( and in WT yβ5 ; B^see^I Appendix Figure S5 ) ) differs from that observed B^with^I the hβ5i / hβ6 chimera .

Residue 31 impacts B^on^I the position of the 3 - methyl - 1H - indene B^cap^I of B^PR^I - 924 and 18 . Due B^to^I steric hindrance , the N - B^cap^I B^is^I shifted in the mouse and in the hβ5i - V31M / hβ6 chimera compared B^to^I the hβ5i / hβ6 mutant proteasome crystal structures ( black B^double^I arrow ) . Note that the structures are rotated by 90° compared B^to^I panel B . 
ONX 0914 binds in a linear B^mode^I B^to^I all active sites . Changing the stereochemistry B^at^I the B^P3^I site from l - B^Ala^I ( S ) B^to^I d - B^Ala^I ( R ) leads B^to^I a kinked conformation in the β5 substrate binding channels ( compound 16 ) . Substitution of the morpholine B^cap^I of 16 by a larger 3 - metyhl - 1H - indene moiety yields B^PR^I - 924 and results in different inhibitor conformations B^at^I the yβ5 / hβ5c and the mammalian β5i active sites . Hereby , the selectivity B^for^I hβ5i over hβ5c B^is^I drastically increased ( IC50 ratio hβ5c / hβ5i : 255 ) compared B^to^I ONX 0914 ( IC50 ratio hβ5c / hβ5i : 20 ) and compound 16 ( IC50 ratio hβ5c / hβ5i : 5 . 2 , B^Fig^I 2 ) . Residue B^Met31^I of mβ5i sterically hinders the kinked binding B^mode^I of B^PR^I - 924 , thereby creating 7 - B^fold^I selectivity B^for^I human β5i .

B . Salmonella B^with^I prolonged cytosolic residence and strong activation of the B^GFP^I - reporter gene ( green arrow ) are B^not^I recognized by the LC3C specific sensor B^mCh^I - B^AS3^I _ 67 . 
C . A subpopulation of hyper proliferative Salmonella in the cytosol B^is^I coated B^with^I endogenous LC3C . In contrast , endogenous LC3B B^is^I enriched in spots in close proximity B^to^I the cytosolic bacteria . 
D . Sensitivity of LC3C specific sensor B^mCh^I - B^AS3^I _ 67 B^is^I increased upon fusion of B^membrane^I - tethering FYVE domain B^or^I B^PB1^I oligomerization domain . 
E . Introduction of the B^PB1^I domain B^to^I B^mCh^I - B^AS3^I _ B^p62^I increases its performance in recognizing endogenous LC3B . 
F . High - performance sensor B^mCh^I - B^PB1^I - B^AS3^I _ 67 B^was^I transiently expressed in Salmonella infected B^HeLa^I cells B^to^I monitor xenophagy events . 
A , B . LC3C specific sensor B^mCh^I - B^PB1^I - B^AS3^I _ 67 B^is^I recruited B^to^I a subset of mitochondria undergoing mitophagy . Mitochondria were labeled B^with^I MitoTracker Deep B^Red^I ( ThermoFisher ) . U2OS cells were transiently co - transfected B^for^I indicated sensor and mATG8 proteins . Mitophagy B^was^I induced by CCCP treatment over three hours . Lysosomal degradation of mitochondria undergoing mitophagy B^was^I blocked by the addition of BafilomycinA1 ( B^Baf^I ) . 
C . Upon depolarization , endogenous LC3C B^is^I localized B^to^I mitochondria labeled B^with^I B^mt^I - mCherry in U2OS cells . B^An^I example of rare events B^with^I nearly complete overlap of signals B^for^I endogenous LC3C and mitochondria ( upper panel ) and a representative image ( lower panel ) B^is^I given . 
D . Overlap of LC3C specific sensor signal B^with^I endogenous LC3C and endogenous B^LAMP1^I in U2OS cells induced B^for^I mitophagy .
