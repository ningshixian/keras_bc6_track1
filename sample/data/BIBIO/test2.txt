Configuration of the two - compartment model . The microenvironment of microbial swarmbot is separated from that of the chamber by its permeable hydrogel shell ( orange ) , resulting in two separate compartments , defined as swarmbot and environment ( chamber ) . Four major components involved in the population dynamics are explored in the model , including cell density ( n ) , nutrient ( s ) , carbenicillin ( a ) and BlaM concentration ( b ) . Each component has a different transport rate , depending on the molecule size . Simulated microbial swarmbot dynamics under a static condition . a = 0 . 4 , a microbial swarmbot B^with^I a low n0 cannot initiate growth ( B^red^I lines ) B^but^I one B^with^I a high n0 leads to growth both in the swarmbot and , after a delay , in the chamber ( green lines ) . While ( C ) swarmbots B^with^I both low and high initial densities lead to eventual full growth in the chamber in the absence of the antibiotic ( a = 0 ) . Solid lines : cell density inside swarmbots ; dashed lines : cell density in the chambers . ( D ) A microfluidic device B^for^I controlling and monitoring population dynamics of microbial swarmbot . The device consists of an input channel leading to a culturing chamber and a trapping slot . The chamber is used B^for^I culturing engineered bacterial populations both inside and outside the swarmbot , while the trapping slot is B^for^I trapping the swarmbot due to its smaller size B^but^I allowing the medium to flow through . Input flow patterns ( static or pulsing ) are controlled by a programmable syringe pump . ( E ) Experimental validation of model prediction . At 100µg / ml carbenicillin , a microbial swarmbot B^with^I a high initial density led to robust growth in the capsule and , after a delay , in the chamber ( green lines ) . While a swarmbot B^with^I a low initial cell density B^did^I B^not^I exhibit growth either in the swarmbot or in the chamber at the same carbenicillin concentration ( B^red^I lines ) . ( F ) In contrast , both the swarmbot and culturing chamber reached high cell densities in absence of carbenicillin , regardless of the initial cell densities . 
 ( G ) B^Time^I - lapse images of microbial swarmbot dynamics . The population initiated growth inside the swarmbot and subsequently in the chamber at a high initial density . But no growth occurred B^for^I a swarmbot B^with^I a low initial density at the same antibiotic concentration ( rightmost ) . The concentration of carbenicillin B^was^I 100 µg / ml and the scale B^bar^I represents 200 µm . ( H ) The control strain lacking BlaM circuit . The population could B^not^I survive at the same concentration of carbenicillin at the high initial density .

Safeguard B^was^I established B^for^I lower nutrient levels ( 0 . 004 % or 0 . 04 % glucose ) along B^with^I carbenicillin treatment . At a high nutrient level ( 0 . 4 % glucose ) , the safeguard B^was^I B^lost^I due to either growth in the chamber ( panels 3 and 6 ) or gradual killing of the population inside swarmbot ( solid line in panel 9 ) . These results are qualitatively consistent B^with^I the model predictions ( Fig 4 ) .

B^For^I the majority of proteins we found a unique translation initiation site ( grey ) . Additionally , 335 N - terminal peptides pointed to proteins B^with^I multiple N - termini created by alternative translation initiation ( B^blue^I ) , whereas 81 N - termini were generated by alternative iMet processing ( green ) . B - C . Proteomics - derived translation initiation events were verified at the transcript level using Ribo - Seq data obtained in Jurkat cells and B^HCT^I 116 cells ( data unpublished ) . Although in this study , the degree of in vivo Nt - acetylation could B^not^I be directly determined , all retained N - termini were compliant B^with^I the rules of N - terminal processing from previous experiments ( Van Damme et al , 2014 ) . In the case N - termini were found to be in vivo Nt - acetylated ( previous B^MS^I / B^MS^I - based evidence ( Van Damme et al , 2014 ) ) this information is indicated . dbTIS and aTIS peptides were further mapped to protein N - termini annotated in Swiss - B^Prot^I Isoform , UniProt TrEMBL and Ensembl databases and B^neo^I - N - termini ( proteolytic products ) of the knowledgebase TopFind 3 . 0 . The number of matching N - termini is indicated in dark grey . N - terminal peptides supported by at least one source of metadata pointing to translation ( Nt - acetylation , Ribo - Seq , Swiss - B^Prot^I Isoforms , TrEMBL or Ensembl ) were classified as highly confident TIS ( indicated in green ) . D . Using experimental and metadata we assigned the most likely origin of aTIS peptides and confirmed that alternative translation initiation within the same transcript ( leaky scanning ) contributes to the majority of alternative TIS identified .

The perturbations on Ub due to binding of B^HHARI^I B^RING1^I and RNF144 B^RING1^I are remarkably similar , while binding of the canonical B^RING^I domain of B^BRCA1^I / B^BARD1^I has no observable effect on the Ub spectrum .

b ) LEFT . Auto - ubiquitination assays were performed B^with^I wild - type B^HHARI^I B^RBR^I or an active site - dead mutant ( C357A - B^HHARI^I B^RBR^I ) . Products were visualized by western blotting against B^GST^I . The zero time point B^was^I taken immediately prior to ATP addition , all other times are B^post^I - ATP addition . RIGHT . Identical assays as shown on left were performed B^with^I the UBR - hybrid . The active site - dead mutant ( C357A ) retains substantial auto - ubiquitination activity signifying that B^UbcH5^I ~ Ub is able to transfer Ub directly onto the B^GST^I - UBR - hybrid construct , bypassing the RING2 active site B^Cys^I .

While a B^HOIP^I ~ Ub thioester species is observed when B^UbcH7^I B^was^I charged B^with^I WT - Ub , no detectable transfer occurs B^with^I the I44A - Ub conjugate ( left ) . Similarly , V70A - Ub shows reduced formation of the B^HHARI^I ~ Ub thioester ( right ) . In addition to blotting B^for^I B^HA^I - Ub , the B^blot^I on the right B^was^I also blotted B^for^I B^GST^I - B^HHARI^I .

B^Time^I points ( 10min ) are visualized by western blotting B^for^I the B^GST^I - B^tag^I on B^HHARI^I . Relative activity of B^HHARI^I WT and mutant forms is clearest when the intensity of the unmodified B^HHARI^I band is compared . 
e ) 1H - 15N - HSQC TROSY spectra of 15N - Ub demonstrate binding by WT B^HHARI^I RING2 , B^but^I B^not^I by mutant B^HHARI^I RING2 constructs that exhibit decreased auto - ubiquitination activity .

A Structure of autoinhibited ScV1 . The catalytic A ( pink ) and non catalytic B ( green ) subunits are arranged as a heterohexamer around the central rotor subunits D ( B^red^I ) and F ( cyan ) . The three peripheral stalks ( EG heterodimers 1 - 3 , B^blue^I and orange , respectively ) are bound at the periphery of the B subunits . The inhibitory H subunit ( yellow ) is unique to the eukaryotic V - B^ATPase^I . Unless otherwise stated , the coloring scheme used here B^for^I the V1 subunits will be used from here on . 
B Interaction of the peripheral stalks B^with^I the catalytic hexamer . Each peripheral stalk crosses a non - catalytic A / B interface on its way from the B^top^I of the V1 to the base of the catalytic core . Representative view of the interaction is shown B^for^I B^EG3^I . 
C Interaction of peripheral stalks B^EG1^I and 2 B^with^I the catalytic hexamer . The peripheral stalks are bound to the B^top^I of the B subunits via their C - termini ( boxed ) . The electron density ( contoured at 1 . 2 σ ) B^for^I the C - terminal domains of B^EG1^I and B^EG2^I is shown in the panels to the left and right . D The structure of autoinhibited ScV1rotated 90° around the vertical from the view shown in panel A to highlight peripheral stalks B^EG2^I and B^EG3^I . Note the bent appearance of B^EG3^I compared to B^EG2^I along B^with^I the presence of a partially unstructured region known as the " bulge " in subunit G ( indicated B^with^I an arrow ) . The box shows electron density ( contoured at 1 . 2 σ ) B^for^I the B^EG3^I N - termini contacting the C - terminal domain of the A subunit of a closed catalytic site ( see asterisk ) . The horizontal lines on the structure indicate the sections shown in panels E ( upper two lines ) and F ( lower two lines ) . 
E Section through the ScV1 electron density B^map^I showing interaction of the A3B3 catalytic hexamer B^with^I the peripheral stalks ( B^EG1^I - 3 ) . View is rotated 90° from the view in A , looking up the central rotor . The A / B pairs forming the three catalytic sites are designated ( AB ) 1 - 3 according to which of the three peripheral stalks is bound to each B subunit . B^For^I example , ( AB ) 1 has peripheral stalk B^EG1^I bound to its B subunit . The black arrowheads indicate the non - catalytic A / B interfaces . 
F Section through the ScV1 electron density B^map^I at the level of the N - termini of the peripheral stalks . Note the change in position of the N - termini of the peripheral stalks , which have each crossed a non - catalytic interface ( black arrowheads in E ) and are now in proximity to the C - termini of the catalytic A subunits ( B^ACT^I ) of the adjacent A / B pairs . While B^EG1^I and B^EG2^I are now near B^ACT^I from ( AB ) 3 and ( AB ) 1 , respectively ( see B^double^I headed arrows ) , only the bent B^EG3^I peripheral stalk is close enough to contact the corresponding B^ACT^I from ( AB ) 2 ( see asterisk ) . 
A The A3B3DF complex shown B^with^I the subunits unique to the eukaryotic V1 removed , highlighting the core conserved catalytic complex labeled as " Catalytic core " . The three peripheral stalks and inhibitory subunit H are found only in the eukaryotic V1 , whereas A3B3DF represents the full complement of subunits in the prokaryotic V1 complex . Notably , the prokaryotic V1 is an active ATP hydrolase ( Arai et al , 2009 ) . The orientation of the A and B subunits B^with^I respect to the B^membrane^I is indicated by the arrow on the left . 
B Conformational differences in the catalytic A subunits . The catalytic A subunits are shown aligned by their N - terminal β barrels , highlighting the change in conformation of C - terminal α helical bundles associated B^with^I the closed ( ( AB ) 2 and ( AB ) 3 ; dark and B^light^I gray , respectively ) and open ( ( AB ) 1 ; magenta ) catalytic sites . Movement of this domain in response to nucleotide occupancy is thought to drive rotation of the central rotor during catalysis . 
C ScV1 ' s catalytic hexamer contains one open and two closed catalytic sites . Side view of the three catalytic hexamer A / B pairs ( shown in surface representation ) . Note that the two closed pairs ( AB ) 2 and 3 are non - equivalently closed . 
D Alignment of the A3B3DF from ScV1 and nucleotide - free EhV1 by the catalytic hexamers . The A3B3DF from ScV1 is shown in the same color scheme as in Fig 2 , EhV1 is in B^blue^I . The alignment shows the difference in position of the central rotor subunit , D . Note that the C - terminus of subunit D ( B^DCT^I ) is longer in eukaryotic V - B^ATPase^I ( see electron density contoured at 1 . 2 σ in the box to the right ) . E ScV1 and EhV1are halted in different rotational positions . Alignment of the A3B3DF of ScV1 and nucleotide - free EhV1 ( B^blue^I , B^with^I dashed lines drawn through the A subunits ) by the central stalk subunit D , reveals that the two catalytic cores are halted in different rotational positions . The autoinhibited ScV1 requires 40° rotation to overlay its catalytic hexamer B^with^I that of the EhV1 . 
F Comparison of the D subunits of ScV1 ( B^red^I ) and nucleotide free EhV1 ( B^blue^I ) . B^HCT^I from ScV1 is shown in yellow and A subunit from EhV1 is shown in dark B^blue^I . 
A ScV1 - H subunit interactions . Region of electron density ( contoured at 1 . 2 σ ) outlined by the box in the B^side^I view of ScV1 shown to the right . The H subunit N - terminal domain ( HNT ) is bound to the N - terminal α helices of peripheral stalk B^EG1^I while its globular C - terminal domain ( B^HCT^I ) is bound at the base of the catalytic hexamer . 
B Interaction between HNT and peripheral stalk B^EG1^I . View of HNT as in panel A rotated 110° along the horizontal , showing the α helical HEAT repeats of HNTforming a pocket B^for^I binding the N - termini of peripheral stalk B^EG1^I . HNT ' s α helices forming the pocket are labeled as in ( Sagermann et al , 2001 ) . Pro197 on HNT ( B^red^I sphere ) has been previously shown to cross - B^link^I subunit E ( Jefferies & Forgac , 2008 ) . C Interaction between B^HCT^I and the base of the catalytic hexamer . The H subunit inhibitory contacts at the base of the ScV1 are mediated by a loop in B^HCT^I ( highlighted in magenta ) that is seen to contact two short segments of the C - terminal domain of the subunit G from the open catalytic site ( AB ) 1 ( highlighted in purple ) and two turns of the N - terminal a helix of the central rotor subunit D ( highlighted in B^blue^I ) . 
D B^HCT^I binds to the open ( AB ) 1 pair . View of ScV1 looking along the central rotor subunit D towards the cytoplasm , showing the position of the H subunit binding at the interface of the open A / B pair ( AB ) 1 . The catalytic hexamer is shown in surface representation and the central rotor , peripheral stalks and subunit H are shown as ribbons . 
C Growth phenotype of H subunit mutants . Deletion of V - B^ATPase^I subunits from yeast results in a conditional lethal phenotype ( Vma - ) characterized by an inability to grow at pH 7 . 5 in the presence of 60 mM CaCl2 ( upper panel ) , B^but^I growth is observed at pH 5 ( lower panel ) . Subunit H mutations were introduced on a plasmid into a yeast strain deleted B^for^I the H subunit and their phenotypes assessed . Both human H subunit isoforms ( HsH1 , HsH2 ) , a chimeric H subunit ( HChim ) containing ScHNT and HsHCT , mutations in yeast intended to mimic the length of the human H loop sequence and accessibility ( Hloop ) , and a point mutation of the conserved aspartic acid residue in the loop sequence ( HD410A ) are shown compared to the H subunit deletion ( ΔH ) and wild type H on a plasmid ( H WTpl ) . All grow on pH 5 medium , B^but^I the human isoforms failed to complement the deletion phenotype . 
D B^ATPase^I activity of H subunit mutants . The ScV1 sectors were purified from each strain that complemented the phenotype as well as from ScV1ΔH , B^for^I comparison of MgATPase activity . Average specific activities are shown plotted + / - s . e . m from two independent purifications . The ScV1 sector containing chromosomally encoded H subunit shows no detectable MgATPase activity ( Parra et al , 2000 ; Zhang et al , 2003 ) , whereas ScV1containing plasmid - borne wild type H ( H WTpl ) exhibits low levels of activity likely due to reduced expression from the low copy plasmid . The HChim and HLoop mutants lead to a loss of activity silencing , displaying nearly the same activity as ScV1ΔH . 
E B^SDS^I - PAGE and Western B^Blot^I analysis of ScV1 preparations . Left panel , 15 % B^SDS^I PAGE of ScV1 purified from the subunit H mutant and WT strains . Note that H WTch is purified from a yeast strain deleted B^for^I the C subunit ( used B^for^I crystallization ) . The remaining strains contain subunit C , which is co - purified B^with^I ScV1 in varying levels . Note that while H WTch ScV1 , which is expressed from a strain deleted B^for^I subunit C , displays no detectable MgATPase activity , the H subunit mutants co - purified B^with^I the most C subunit display the least activity , suggesting that absence or presence of subunit C has no effect on MgATPase activity . Right panel , immunoblot probed B^with^I an antibody directed against the N - terminal B^Myc^I tagged mutant H subunits expressed from a plasmid . Note that the levels of mutant H expression does B^not^I appear to vary from strain to strain . 
A Overlay of ScV1 and the cryo - EM structure of the V1Vo holoenzyme in " state 2 " ( Zhao et al , 2015 ) . The structures of ScV1 and ScV1Vo were overlaid by aligning the A3B3 catalytic hexamers , thus highlighting structural differences in the central rotor and peripheral stator subunits . Coloring of ScV1Vo ( shown as semi - transparent ribbons ) is as used throughout B^for^I ScV1 B^for^I all B^but^I the A3B3F ( B^tan^I ) , subunit H ( dark green ) , subunit C and Vo domain ( gray ) . The B^EG1^I - HNT interaction is boxed . Note the shift in position of HNT and B^EG1^I between ScV1 and ScV1Vo . 
B Comparison of peripheral stalk B^EG1^I and HNT in ScV1 versus ScV1Vo . The boxed view in A is shown enlarged . The N - terminal α helices of peripheral stalk B^EG1^I and HNT change in conformation , likely induced by the movement of B^HCT^I when going from the holo enzyme to the autoinhibited conformation . 
C View as in A rotated 150º around the vertical . Comparisons of peripheral stalk B^EG3^I and B^HCT^I are boxed . D Comparison of peripheral stalk B^EG3^I in ScV1 versus ScV1Vo . In ScV1Vo , B^EG3^I binds to the C subunit head domain ( Chead ; gray ) whereas in ScV1 , B^EG3^I is bent towards the C - terminal domain of a catalytic A subunit ( enlarged view of box labeled B^EG3^I in panel C ) . E Comparison of B^HCT^I ' s conformation in ScV1 versus ScV1Vo . Enlarged view of box labeled B^HCT^I in panel C highlighting the conformational changes and binding interactions of B^HCT^I ; B^for^I clarity only aNT , B^HCT^I and the central rotor ( DF ) are shown . In ScV1Vo , the most C - terminal α helix ( dark green ) of B^HCT^I ( green ) binds to aNT ( B^light^I gray ) , B^with^I the inhibitory loop ( green spheres ) rotated away and inaccessible B^for^I binding the B subunit and the central stalk ( transparent B^red^I ) . In ScV1 , the B^HCT^I ( yellow ) inhibitory loop ( yellow spheres ) binds to the central stalk subunit D ( B^red^I ) and the B subunit of the open ( AB ) 1 catalytic site . The difference in conformation between ScV1Vo and ScV1 involves a ~ 150° rotation of B^HCT^I . Note that the B^HCT^I loop ( spheres ) is rotated away from the central stalk in ScV1Vo whereas in ScV1 , the C - terminal α helix ( orange ) involved in binding aNT is rotated away and unavailable B^for^I rebinding to the B^membrane^I . 
F B^HCT^I conformational changes . Available subunit H structures as obtained B^for^I isolated H ( Sagermann et al , 2001 ) ( purple ) , in ScV1Vo ( Zhao et al , 2015 ) ( green ) and in ScV1 ( yellow ) are shown aligned by their N - terminal domains ( HNT ) illustrating the conformational flexibility of B^HCT^I . The loop involved in inhibition of ScV1 is shown as B^red^I spheres , highlighting the 180º rotation of B^HCT^I when going from the conformation of isolated H ( B^HCT^I 1ho8 ) to the inhibitory conformation in ScV1 ( B^HCT^I ScV1 ) .

Strikingly , the fatty tissue is located in the internal parts of almost all the affected muscles in thigh ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 - 9 ) , while the external regions are spared . At calf level , only the gastrocnemius medialis muscle ( 12 ) shows this pattern , while the soleus ( 13 ) is diffusely involved .

In muscle , expression of αDG - IIH6 is reduced B^but^I the αDG - Core shows similar expression as controls , B^with^I a slight reduction in molecular weight ; laminin overlay assay detected some binding activity B^but^I B^was^I diminished compared to controls , whereas agrin - binding activity showed no difference B^with^I controls . In fibroblasts , both αDG - IIH6 and αDG - Core expression and laminin - binding activity were normal , suggesting that unlike other muscular dystrophies , α - dystroglycan glycosylation defect is muscle - specific in B^POGLUT1^I patients .

A B^Protein O^I - glucosyltransferase activity of wild - type ( WT ) or D233E mutant B^POGLUT1^I protein toward human factor B^IX^I B^EGF^I repeat ( hFIX - B^EGF^I ) . Wild - type shows higher O - glucosyltransferase activity than D233E , and this activity is dependent on the concentration of the acceptor substrate hFIX - B^EGF^I repeat ( left ) and on the concentration of donor substrate UDP - glucose ( UDP - Glc ) ( right ) . Values indicate mean ± SEM from three independent assays . 
B O - glucosyltransferase activity towards five different single B^EGF^I repeats from mouse B^Notch1^I . Wild - type B^POGLUT1^I shows higher activity toward all B^EGF^I repeats tested than B^POGLUT1^I D233E . The Y - axis shows the normalized activity relative to wild - type B^POGLUT1^I .

C Elution profiles of the B^POGLUT1^I reaction products on reverse phase HPLC . hFIX - B^EGF^I repeat B^was^I incubated B^with^I wild - type or D233E mutant B^POGLUT1^I and donor substrate , UDP - Glc or UDP - xylose ( UDP - Xyl ) , at 37ºC overnight . Values on B^top^I of the peaks indicate the measured masses . Addition of Glc ( 162 Da ) or xylose ( 132 Da ) to hFIX - B^EGF^I ( 5696 . 2 Da ) by wild - type B^POGLUT1^I caused a shift to an earlier retention time ( left ) . Similarly , the products exhibited a similar shift after incubation B^with^I B^POGLUT1^I D233E ( right ) . These results indicate that B^POGLUT1^I D233E B^can^I B^add^I a single glucose or xylose to hFIX - B^EGF^I repeats and thus has residual enzymatic activity .

B - B " B^rumi^I 79 / 79 mutants raised at 18C show no obvious defects in myoblast number or myotube morphology . C - D " B^rumi^I 79 / 79 mutants exhibit decreased number of myoblasts at 25° - 30 °C and either an incomplete B^set^I of short myotubes when raised at 25C or aberrant morphology of myotubes when raised at 30C . E - E " B^rumi^I 79 / 79 animals overexpressing FLAG - tagged B^POGLUT1^I WT in the muscle compartment using B^Mef2^I - B^GAL4^I and raised at 25C during the pupal stage show a rescue of the B^rumi^I 79 / 79 muscle phenotype . F - G " Overexpression of FLAG - tagged B^POGLUT1^I D233E only partially rescues the B^rumi^I 79 / 79 muscle phenotype , B^with^I some variation in the myotube length and the number of restored Twist + cells ( compare G and F ) . Note that the number of Twist + cells restored by B^POGLUT1^I D233E is much smaller than that restored by B^POGLUT1^I WT . Scale B^bar^I in A ' is 50 µm and applies to A - G " . H Quantification of myotube lengths in B^rumi^I 79 / 79 mutants B^with^I or without B^POGLUT1^I expression indicates a weak rescue of the phenotypes by B^POGLUT1^I D233E compared to B^POGLUT1^I WT . Mean ± standard deviation is shown . The differences in myotube lengths are statistically significant ( n = 22 - 54 ) . Mean ± standard deviation is shown ; One - way Anova B^with^I Bonferroni´s multiple comparisons test . 
A - F Proliferation assays examined proliferating ( B^PAX7^I + B^MyoD^I + , arrows ) , self - renewing ( B^PAX7^I + B^MyoD^I − , open arrows ) , and differentiating ( B^PAX7^I − B^MyoD^I + , arrowheads ) cells from D233E patients ( n = 2 ) , healthy controls ( n = 3 ) and disease controls ( n = 3 ) at 1 , 4 , and 8 days growing in proliferation medium . ( A ) shows representative images from day 8 . The number of patientmyoblasts is lower than that of controls at all three time points , indicating a slower proliferation rate in patientmyoblasts ( B ) , and accordingly , the percentage of proliferating cells ( C ) is smaller in the patient . ( D ) The percentage of self - renewing cells is small in patient´s culture , reflecting a poor capacity B^for^I maintaining the pool of quiescent SCs . In addition , the percentage of B^PAX7^I + cells ( E ) is smaller in patient´s culture , similarly to what B^was^I found in adult D233E muscle ( shown in Fig 5D ) . ( F ) The percentage of differentiating cells is higher in the patient . We examine proliferation capturing 7 - 12 randomly fields B^per^I day and condition ( mean ± SEM is shown ; Kruskal - Wallis B^with^I Dunn´s multiple comparisons test ; Scale B^bar^I , 50 µm ) . 
G - I When myoblasts started to be confluent , the proliferation medium B^was^I replaced B^with^I differentiation medium , and the myoblasts started to B^fuse^I yielding myotubes , which were analyzed after four days of differentiation . ( H ) The fusion index , which measures the percentage of nuclei in myotubes B^with^I respect to the total number of nuclei in myogenic cells , B^was^I higher in D233E cultures than in controls . ( I ) Besides , myogenin showed increased expression in D233E myoblast cultures compared to controls . The data support that differentiation process is facilitated in patient´s muscle . Data B^was^I collected from 3 - 10 randomly chosen areas B^per^I condition ( mean ± SEM is shown ; Kruskal - Wallis B^with^I Dunn´s multiple comparisons test ( H ) and One - way Anova B^with^I Bonferroni´s multiple comparisons test ( I ) ; Scale B^bar^I , 50 µm ) . 
A - C We overexpressed GFP - tagged NICD in immortalized primary myoblasts to rescue the features displayed by immortalized D233E myoblasts . ( B ) We analyzed the proliferation at 1 , 3 and 5 days , and proliferation rate in patient - LV - NICD - GFP reached the level observed in control - LV - GFP , which were higher than in patient - LV - GFP . ( C ) However , the percentage of B^PAX7^I + cells in patient - LV - NICD - GFP showed the same reduced value as in patient - LV - GFP , which were significantly lower than in control - LV - GFP . The majority of control myoblasts were proliferating cells ( B^PAX7^I + B^MyoD^I + , arrows ) , B^with^I no quiescent cells and few differentiating cells detected . Data were collected from n = 2 independent assays ( 5 - 8 images B^per^I condition ) . Mean ± SEM is shown ; One - way Anova B^with^I Tukey multiple comparisions test ( B ) and Kruskal - Wallis B^with^I Dunn´s multiple comparisons test ( C ) ; Scale B^bar^I , 50 µm ) . 
D - F As previously described in patient ' s primary myoblasts , patient - LV - GFP myoblasts showed a striking facilitated differentiation compared to control - LV - GFP - myoblasts . This phenotype fully disappeared in patient - LV - GFP - NICD myoblasts , as quantification of the fusion index ( E ) , and myogenin expression ( F ) demonstrated . The data support a pathogenic role B^for^I B^Notch^I inhibition on the altered differentiation in our patients . Data were collected from n = 3 independent assays ( 13 - 17 images B^per^I condition ) . Mean ± SEM is shown ; Kruskal - Wallis B^with^I Dunn´s multiple comparisons test ; Scale B^bar^I , 50 µm ) . 
A Immortalized primary myoblasts from a healthy control showed a progressive pattern of α - dystroglycan glycosylation during five days of differentiation ( D0 - D5 ) , as has been previously described by Goddeeris et al . Immortalized primary myoblasts from patients displayed an irregular pattern of glycosylation , B^with^I a final level of glycosylated α - dystroglycan that B^was^I lower than control . 
B α - dystroglycan glycosylation of infected immortalized myoblasts from patient - LV - NICD - GFP at differentiation day 5 ( D5 ) showed a striking reduction , in line B^with^I the strong inhibition of myotubes formation and differentiation induced by NICD overexpression . α - dystroglycan in myoblasts from patient - LV - GFP showed a reduction of glycosylation compared to control - LV - GFP at D5 , similar to the results obtained in the adult muscle from patients ( Fig . 2 ) . 
C - D C2C12 myogenic cells showed a reduced level of glycosylated α - dystroglycan when the B^Notch^I signaling inhibitor DAPT or LY3039478 B^was^I added to the differentiation medium . This indicates that reducing B^Notch^I signaling B^can^I affect α - dystroglycan glycosylation in wild - type C2C12 myoblasts cells , which do B^not^I harbor any known mutations in α - dystroglycan glycosyltransferases or B^Poglut1^I . 
E - F qRT - B^PCR^I experiments show that upon DAPT or LY3039478 treatment , a remarkable decrease in B^Hes1^I mRNA is induced in C2C12 cells during differentiation .

Trajectories of these speckles are also illustrated , and crosses were plotted at the B^end^I of the directional movement . Speckles showing directional movement were frequently observed in cells expressing GFP - B^DIA1^I ( R1204X ) ( B ) , whereas such speckles were scarce in cells expressing GFP - B^DIA1^I ( WT ) ( A ) . However , the density of these speckles in GFP - B^DIA1^I ( R1204X ) - expressing cells appeared lower than that in GFP - B^DIA1^I ( M1190D ) - expressing cells , which is considered a fully active mutant ( C ) . To evaluate the frequency of speckles indicating directional movement , we performed a quantitative analysis ( D ) .

 ( A ) Chromosome 7 of S . bayanus is incompatible B^with^I the S . cerevisiae genome . The chromosome 7 replacement stain ( Sc + Sb - chr7 ) exhibited serious growth defects when grown on the non - fermentable carbon source ( glycerol ) . The respiration defects could be partially rescued when a whole B^set^I of S . bayanus chromosomes were provided ( Sc + Sb - chr7 x Sb - ρ⁰ ) , or fully rescued B^with^I the addition of S . bayanus mtDNA ( Sc + Sb - chr7 - ρ⁰ x Sb ) . Cell cultures were serially - diluted and spotted onto YPD ( glucose ) or YPG ( glycerol ) plates . The plates were then incubated at 28 °C until colonies were easily observed . Sc , S . cerevisiae . Sb , S . bayanus . ρ⁰ , mtDNA - less strains .

 ( C ) Sb - B^CCM1^I incompatibility could only be rescued in the presence of S . bayanus mtDNA . The native B^CCM1^I B^ORF^I in S . cerevisiae B^was^I replaced by either Sb - B^CCM1^I ( Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I ) or Sc - B^CCM1^I ( Sc + Sc - B^CCM1^I , as a control ) coding regions .

Both Sc - Ccm1 and Sb - Ccm1 were fused B^with^I c - B^Myc^I at the C - terminus and expressed from a single - copy plasmid . The B^Myc^I - tagged Ccm1 proteins consistently appeared as B^double^I bands , which were probably due to some unknown protein modifications .

 ( E ) The steady - state level of mtDNA - encoded proteins is reduced in Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I cells . Immunoblotting B^for^I the mitochondrial proteins in Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I ( labeled as Sb ) or Sc + Sc - B^CCM1^I ( labeled as Sc ) cells . Cox1 , B^Cox2^I and B^Cox3^I are mtDNA - encoded complex B^IV^I subunits . B^Tom20^I is a nucleus - encoded mitochondrial protein . 
 ( A ) Tetrad analysis reveals that the respiration defect of Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I cells B^can^I be rescued by mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear genomes . The suppressor clones were crossed B^with^I the Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I - ρ⁰ strain and the tetrads from the cross were analyzed . A non - Mendelian 4 : 0 segregation pattern B^for^I improved respiration is expected if the suppressor mutation is in mtDNA ( left panel ) . Otherwise , a 2 : 2 segregation pattern would be observed if the rescue effect involved a single nuclear mutation ( right panel ) . 
 ( A ) Reconstituted Sb - B^CCM1^I mutants B^can^I rescue the incompatibility of Sb - B^CCM1^I . Among 94 suppressor clones , 20 of them carry mutations in the Sb - B^CCM1^I gene . These mutants were reconstructed in Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I cells to test their function . Superscripts next to Sb - B^CCM1^I indicate the respective amino acid substitutions and numbers in parentheses indicate the number of independent clones in our suppressor screen . Sc , wild - type S . cerevisiae . 
 ( C ) The 400th residue plays a determinant role in the S . cerevisiae - S . bayanus incompatibility . Both Sb - B^CCM1^I E375Q and Sb - B^CCM1^I D400N mutants relieved the incompatibility in S . cerevisiae , B^but^I only Sb - B^CCM1^I D400N caused respiration defects in S . bayanus . The Sb - B^CCM1^I E375Q mutant B^was^I selected as a control in this experiment since it B^was^I a charged - to - polar substitution similar to Sb - B^CCM1^I D400N and also appeared three times in our screen . Sb , wild - type S . bayanus .

The syntheses of the ligands B^PR^I - 924 , 9 , 14 , 16 , 17 and 18 have been described previously ( de Bruin et al , 2014 ) . All ligands share the peptide scaffold shown in the upper left corner B^with^I B^P1^I , B^P2^I and B^P3^I B^side^I chains and an N - B^cap^I ; they are equipped B^with^I a l - Ala ( stereochemistry ( S ) ) or d - Ala ( stereochemistry ( R ) ) residue at B^P3^I ( B^red^I ) and either an N - acylmorpholine or a 3 - methyl - 1H - indene group ( green ) . Furthermore , compounds differ in their B^P2^I residue ( either methoxytyrosine or tryptophane ; B^blue^I ) . Inhibitor 9 , also termed LU - 015i , is endowed B^with^I an exceptional cyclohexyl residue ( gray ) , which is associated B^with^I increased selectivity B^for^I human β5i .

The 2FO - B^FC^I electron density maps B^for^I the ligands bound to Thr1 of the chimeric β5 active sites are shown as B^blue^I meshes contoured at 1σ . The inhibitor and Thr1 have been omitted B^for^I phasing . 
B . Comparison of the conformations of ONX 0914 , B^PR^I - 924 , 14 , 16 , 17 and 18 bound to the chimeric hβ5 / hβ6 substrate binding channels . The l amino acid compounds ONX 0914 and 14 display a linear ( l ) binding mode to the hβ5c / hβ6 ( left ) and the hβ5i / hβ6 ( right ) chimeras , whereas the ligands 16 and 17 ( B^P3^I - d - Ala and morpholine B^cap^I ) adopt a kinked ( k ) conformation in both β5 substrate binding channels . Remarkably , the orientation of B^PR^I - 924 and its analogue 18 ( B^P3^I - d - Ala and 3 - methyl - 1H - indene B^cap^I ) in the hβ5c / hβ6 chimera ( and in WT yβ5 ; see Appendix Figure S5 ) ) differs from that observed B^with^I the hβ5i / hβ6 chimera . Note that the inhibitors are rotated by about 45 ° compared to panel A .

B . Superposition of inhibitors bound to the mouse chimeric proteasome ( left ) and the hβ5i - V31M / hβ6 mutant ( right ) . Compounds display the same binding modes ( kinked ( k ) or linear ( l ) ) to the mβ5i / mβ6 active site as to the corresponding human β5i / β6 subunit ( Fig . 5 ) and to the hβ5i - V31M / hβ6 mutant . Note that the inhibitors are rotated by about 45° compared to panel A . 
C . Superposition of chimeric mammalian and WT yeast β5 active sites bound to the B^P3^I - d - Ala compounds B^PR^I - 924 and 18 . The nucleophilic Thr1 is depicted as well as the S1 pocket forming residues 31 and 45 . Residue 31 impacts on the position of the 3 - methyl - 1H - indene B^cap^I of B^PR^I - 924 and 18 . Due to steric hindrance , the N - B^cap^I is shifted in the mouse and in the hβ5i - V31M / hβ6 chimera compared to the hβ5i / hβ6 mutant proteasome crystal structures ( black B^double^I arrow ) . Note that the structures are rotated by 90° compared to panel B . 
ONX 0914 binds in a linear mode to all active sites . Changing the stereochemistry at the B^P3^I site from l - Ala ( S ) to d - Ala ( R ) leads to a kinked conformation in the β5 substrate binding channels ( compound 16 ) . Substitution of the morpholine B^cap^I of 16 by a larger 3 - metyhl - 1H - indene moiety yields B^PR^I - 924 and results in different inhibitor conformations at the yβ5 / hβ5c and the mammalian β5i active sites . Hereby , the selectivity B^for^I hβ5i over hβ5c is drastically increased ( IC50 ratio hβ5c / hβ5i : 255 ) compared to ONX 0914 ( IC50 ratio hβ5c / hβ5i : 20 ) and compound 16 ( IC50 ratio hβ5c / hβ5i : 5 . 2 , Fig 2 ) . Residue Met31 of mβ5i sterically hinders the kinked binding mode of B^PR^I - 924 , thereby creating 7 - fold selectivity B^for^I human β5i .
