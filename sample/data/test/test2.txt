A , B THP - 1macrophages proficient for B^NLRP3^I ( transfected B^with^I scrambled control , A ) or deficient for B^NLRP3^I ( sh B^NLRP3^I , B ) were treated B^with^I 1 μM pigment or Δ B^cylE^I extract for 20 min , and propidium iodide ( PI ) was added during the final 10 min . PI uptake was measured by flow cytometry , and data shown are representative of two independent experiments . 
C , D Intracellular potassium concentration was measured by ICP - AES . THP - 1macrophages transfected B^with^I the scrambled control ( C ) or sh B^NLRP3^I ( D ) were treated B^with^I GBSpigment ( 1 μM ) or an equivalent amount of the ΔcylE extract . At various B^time^I points , cells were lysed and intracellular [ K + ] was measured relative to untreated cells ( see bars and left y - axis ) , and percent cell death was quantified by alamar B^blue^I ( see squares , B^dotted^I connecting lines and right y - axis ) . Both B^NLRP3^I - proficient and B^NLRP3^I - deficient macrophages initially lose intracellular K + due to GBSpigment ( compare t = 0 min to t = 30 min ) , but the B^NLRP3^I - deficient cells ( sh B^NLRP3^I ) are able to recover , while the scrambled control do not , demonstrating that initial K + loss occurs independently of B^NLRP3^I .

Data shown are three independent experiments performed in triplicate and were analyzed using Bonferroni ' s multiple comparison B^test^I following ANOVA , error bars ± SEM ( n = 3 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , * * P = 0 . 0036 ) . 
THP - 1macrophages were treated B^with^I GBSpigment , and B^caspase 1^I activation was measured by flow cytometry using a B^FLICA^I reagent . Pigment treatment of the scrambled shRNA control cell B^line^I induces more B^caspase 1^I activation compared to the sh B^NLRP3^I cell B^line^I , demonstrating that the pigment activates B^caspase 1^I exclusively through the B^NLRP3^I inflammasome . Results are representative of three independent experiments . 
WT THP - 1macrophages were treated B^with^I the B^caspase 1^I inhibitor Z - B^YVAD^I - FMK , the B^caspase 3^I / 7 inhibitor Z - DEVD - FMK , or DMSO only prior to treatment B^with^I the GBSpigment . B^YVAD^I is able to significantly decrease cytotoxicity in cells treated B^with^I GBSpigment , demonstrating that B^caspase 1^I is required for GBSpigment - mediated cell death , characteristic of pyroptosis , while DEVD had no effect . Data are average of three independent experiments , error bars ± SEM . Significance was determined using Bonferroni ' s multiple comparison B^test^I following ANOVA ( n = 3 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , * * * P = 0 . 0002 , * P = 0 . 014 ) .

Configuration of the two - compartment model . The microenvironment of microbial swarmbot is separated from that of the chamber by its permeable hydrogel shell ( orange ) , resulting in two separate compartments , defined as swarmbot and environment ( chamber ) . Four major components involved in the population dynamics are explored in the model , including cell density ( n ) , nutrient ( s ) , carbenicillin ( a ) and B^BlaM^I concentration ( b ) . Each component has a different transport rate , depending on the molecule B^size^I . Simulated microbial swarmbot dynamics under a static condition . a = 0 . 4 , a microbial swarmbot B^with^I a low n0 cannot initiate growth ( red lines ) but one B^with^I a high n0 leads to growth both in the swarmbot and , after a delay , in the chamber ( green lines ) . While ( C ) swarmbots B^with^I both low and high initial densities lead to eventual B^full^I growth in the chamber in the absence of the antibiotic ( a = 0 ) . Solid lines : cell density inside swarmbots ; dashed lines : cell density in the chambers . ( D ) A microfluidic device for controlling and monitoring population dynamics of microbial swarmbot . The device consists of an input channel leading to a culturing chamber and a trapping slot . The chamber is used for culturing engineered bacterial populations both inside and outside the swarmbot , while the trapping slot is for trapping the swarmbot due to its smaller B^size^I but allowing the medium to flow through . Input flow patterns ( static or pulsing ) are controlled by a programmable syringe pump . ( E ) Experimental validation of model prediction . At 100µg / ml carbenicillin , a microbial swarmbot B^with^I a high initial density led to robust growth in the capsule and , after a delay , in the chamber ( green lines ) . While a swarmbot B^with^I a low initial cell density did not exhibit growth either in the swarmbot or in the chamber at the same carbenicillin concentration ( red lines ) . ( F ) In contrast , both the swarmbot and culturing chamber reached high cell densities in absence of carbenicillin , regardless of the initial cell densities . 
 ( G ) B^Time^I - lapse images of microbial swarmbot dynamics . The population initiated growth inside the swarmbot and subsequently in the chamber at a high initial density . But no growth occurred for a swarmbot B^with^I a low initial density at the same antibiotic concentration ( rightmost ) . The concentration of carbenicillin was 100 µg / ml and the scale bar represents 200 µm . ( H ) The control strain lacking B^BlaM^I circuit . The population could not survive at the same concentration of carbenicillin at the high initial density . 
Time courses of swarmbots treated B^with^I varying concentrations of carbenicillin and glucose . Solid lines indicate cell densities inside swarmbots ; B^dotted^I lines indicate those in the chamber . Safeguard was established for lower nutrient levels ( 0 . 004 % or 0 . 04 % glucose ) along B^with^I carbenicillin treatment . At a high nutrient level ( 0 . 4 % glucose ) , the safeguard was B^lost^I due to either growth in the chamber ( panels 3 and 6 ) or gradual killing of the population inside swarmbot ( solid B^line^I in panel 9 ) . These results are qualitatively consistent B^with^I the model predictions ( Fig 4 ) . 
Snapshots of safeguard performance at the end B^time^I point of ( A ) . The red arrow in panel 6 indicates significant growth in the chamber ; the dimmer fluorescence of the swarmbot in panel 9 indicates killing of the population . 
Figure 6 . Experimental control of microbial swarmbot safeguard by other circuits . Demonstration of modular safeguard performance of swarmbots B^with^I different collective survival systems . For the swarmbots containing cells carrying the QS - CAT circuit , pulsing flow of medium containing 100µg / ml chloramphenicol established safeguard control but not for the static condition . For the swarmbots B^with^I the QS - B^BlaM^I circuit , the static condition of 100 µg / ml carbenicillin was sufficient for safeguard control . For all the conditions , safeguard did not occur in the absence of antibiotic ( top panels from each condition ) . All the images were from the swarmbots cultured at 37˚C for 16 hours . The scale bar is 250 µm . 
Figure 1 - The origin of N - terminal proteoforms . A . 2 , 578 proteoforms were identified including 2 , 135 dbTIS and 443 aTIS . For the majority of proteins we found a unique translation initiation site ( grey ) . Additionally , 335 N - terminal peptides pointed to proteins B^with^I multiple N - termini created by alternative translation initiation ( B^blue^I ) , whereas 81 N - termini were generated by alternative iMet processing ( green ) . B - C . Proteomics - derived translation initiation events were verified at the transcript level using Ribo - Seq data obtained in Jurkat cells and HCT 116 cells ( data unpublished ) . Although in B^this^I study , the degree of in vivo Nt - acetylation could not be directly determined , all retained N - termini were compliant B^with^I the rules of N - terminal processing from previous experiments ( Van Damme et al , 2014 ) . In the B^case^I N - termini were found to be in vivo Nt - acetylated ( previous MS / MS - based evidence ( Van Damme et al , 2014 ) ) B^this^I information is indicated . dbTIS and aTIS peptides were further mapped to B^protein N^I - termini annotated in Swiss - B^Prot^I Isoform , UniProt TrEMBL and Ensembl databases and neo - N - termini ( proteolytic products ) of the knowledgebase TopFind 3 . 0 . The number of matching N - termini is indicated in B^dark^I grey . N - terminal peptides supported by at least one source of metadata pointing to translation ( Nt - acetylation , Ribo - Seq , Swiss - B^Prot^I Isoforms , TrEMBL or Ensembl ) were classified as highly confident TIS ( indicated in green ) . D . Using experimental and metadata we assigned the most likely origin of aTIS peptides and confirmed that alternative translation initiation within the same transcript ( leaky scanning ) contributes to the majority of alternative TIS identified .

As evident from the MS spectra shown , these N - terminal proteoforms displayed largely different turnover rates .

Protein degradation was monitored by Western blotting and stabilities of several short - lived endogenous proteins were confirmed using antibodies ( including B^lamin B^I , B^securin^I , β - catenin , GCIP interacting protein p29 ) and compared to stable proteins ( such as B^GAPDH^I and B^actin^I ) . Proteoform - specific bands were used to calculate protein half - lives which were in a good agreement B^with^I turnover times obtained from pSILAC

d ) B^UbcH7^I conjugated B^with^I WT - Ub , I44A - Ub , or V70A Ub as indicated was incubated B^with^I either H887A - B^HOIP^I RBR - LDD ( left ) or H359A - B^HHARI^I RBR ( right ) mutants that allow trapping of the E3 ~ Ub thioester B^with^I WT - Ub ( Stieglitz et al , 2013 ; [ 29 ] ) . While a B^HOIP^I ~ Ub thioester species is observed when B^UbcH7^I was charged B^with^I WT - Ub , no detectable transfer occurs B^with^I the I44A - Ub conjugate ( left ) . Similarly , V70A - Ub shows reduced formation of the B^HHARI^I ~ Ub thioester ( right ) . In addition to blotting for HA - Ub , the B^blot^I on the right was also blotted for GST - B^HHARI^I . 
a ) Top panel . Regions of 1H - 15N - HSQC TROSY spectra of 15N - B^HHARI^I RING2 in the absence ( B^black^I ) and presence of excess Ub ( red ) . Middle panel .

B^HHARI^I mutations that exhibited reduced binding to Ub also show decreased ubiquitination activity in panel d ) . 
A Structure of autoinhibited ScV1 . The catalytic A ( pink ) and non catalytic B ( green ) subunits are arranged as a heterohexamer around the central rotor B^subunits D^I ( red ) and F ( B^cyan^I ) . The three peripheral stalks ( EG heterodimers 1 - 3 , B^blue^I and orange , respectively ) are bound at the periphery of the B^B subunits^I . The inhibitory B^H subunit^I ( yellow ) is unique to the eukaryotic V - B^ATPase^I . Unless otherwise stated , the coloring scheme used here for the V1 subunits will be used from here on . 
B Interaction of the peripheral stalks B^with^I the catalytic hexamer . Each peripheral stalk crosses a non - catalytic A / B interface on its way from the top of the V1 to the B^base^I of the catalytic B^core^I . Representative view of the interaction is shown for EG3 . 
C Interaction of peripheral stalks EG1 and 2 B^with^I the catalytic hexamer . The peripheral stalks are bound to the top of the B^B subunits^I via their C - termini ( boxed ) . The electron density ( contoured at 1 . 2 σ ) for the C - terminal domains of EG1 and EG2 is shown in the panels to the left and right . D The structure of autoinhibited ScV1rotated 90° around the vertical from the view shown in panel A to highlight peripheral stalks EG2 and EG3 . Note the bent appearance of EG3 compared to EG2 along B^with^I the presence of a partially unstructured region known as the " bulge " in B^subunit G^I ( indicated B^with^I an arrow ) . The box shows electron density ( contoured at 1 . 2 σ ) for the EG3 N - termini contacting the C - terminal domain of the B^A subunit^I of a closed catalytic site ( see asterisk ) . The horizontal lines on the structure indicate the sections shown in panels E ( upper two lines ) and F ( lower two lines ) . 
E Section through the ScV1 electron density map showing interaction of the A3B3 catalytic hexamer B^with^I the peripheral stalks ( EG1 - 3 ) . View is rotated 90° from the view in A , looking up the central rotor . The A / B pairs forming the three catalytic sites are designated ( AB ) 1 - 3 according to which of the three peripheral stalks is bound to each B^B subunit^I . For example , ( AB ) 1 has peripheral stalk EG1 bound to its B^B subunit^I . The B^black^I arrowheads indicate the non - catalytic A / B interfaces . 
F Section through the ScV1 electron density map at the level of the N - termini of the peripheral stalks . Note the change in position of the N - termini of the peripheral stalks , which have each crossed a non - catalytic interface ( B^black^I arrowheads in E ) and are now in proximity to the C - termini of the catalytic B^A subunits^I ( ACT ) of the adjacent A / B pairs . While EG1 and EG2 are now near ACT from ( AB ) 3 and ( AB ) 1 , respectively ( see B^double^I headed arrows ) , only the bent EG3 peripheral stalk is close enough to contact the corresponding ACT from ( AB ) 2 ( see asterisk ) . 
A The A3B3DF complex shown B^with^I the subunits unique to the eukaryotic V1 removed , highlighting the B^core^I conserved catalytic complex labeled as " Catalytic B^core^I " . The three peripheral stalks and inhibitory B^subunit H^I are found only in the eukaryotic V1 , whereas A3B3DF represents the B^full^I complement of subunits in the prokaryotic V1 complex . Notably , the prokaryotic V1 is an active ATP hydrolase ( Arai et al , 2009 ) . The orientation of the A and B^B subunits^I B^with^I respect to the B^membrane^I is indicated by the arrow on the left . 
B Conformational differences in the catalytic B^A subunits^I . The catalytic B^A subunits^I are shown aligned by their N - terminal β barrels , highlighting the change in conformation of C - terminal α helical bundles associated B^with^I the closed ( ( AB ) 2 and ( AB ) 3 ; B^dark^I and B^light^I gray , respectively ) and open ( ( AB ) 1 ; magenta ) catalytic sites . Movement of B^this^I domain in response to nucleotide occupancy is thought to drive rotation of the central rotor during catalysis . 
C ScV1 ' s catalytic hexamer contains one open and two closed catalytic sites . B^Side^I view of the three catalytic hexamer A / B pairs ( shown in surface representation ) . Note that the two closed pairs ( AB ) 2 and 3 are non - equivalently closed . 
D Alignment of the A3B3DF from ScV1 and nucleotide - free EhV1 by the catalytic hexamers . The A3B3DF from ScV1 is shown in the same color scheme as in Fig 2 , EhV1 is in B^blue^I . The alignment shows the difference in position of the central rotor subunit , D . Note that the C - terminus of B^subunit D^I ( DCT ) is longer in eukaryotic V - B^ATPase^I ( see electron density contoured at 1 . 2 σ in the box to the right ) . E ScV1 and EhV1are halted in different rotational positions . Alignment of the A3B3DF of ScV1 and nucleotide - free EhV1 ( B^blue^I , B^with^I dashed lines drawn through the B^A subunits^I ) by the central stalk B^subunit D^I , reveals that the two catalytic cores are halted in different rotational positions . The autoinhibited ScV1 requires 40° rotation to overlay its catalytic hexamer B^with^I that of the EhV1 . 
F Comparison of the B^D subunits^I of ScV1 ( red ) and nucleotide free EhV1 ( B^blue^I ) . HCT from ScV1 is shown in yellow and B^A subunit^I from EhV1 is shown in B^dark^I B^blue^I . 
A ScV1 - B^H subunit^I interactions . Region of electron density ( contoured at 1 . 2 σ ) outlined by the box in the B^side^I view of ScV1 shown to the right . The B^H subunit^I N - terminal domain ( HNT ) is bound to the N - terminal α helices of peripheral stalk EG1 while its globular C - terminal domain ( HCT ) is bound at the B^base^I of the catalytic hexamer . 
B Interaction between HNT and peripheral stalk EG1 . View of HNT as in panel A rotated 110° along the horizontal , showing the α helical HEAT repeats of HNTforming a pocket for binding the N - termini of peripheral stalk EG1 . HNT ' s α helices forming the pocket are labeled as in ( Sagermann et al , 2001 ) . Pro197 on HNT ( red sphere ) has been previously shown to cross - B^link^I B^subunit E^I ( Jefferies & Forgac , 2008 ) . C Interaction between HCT and the B^base^I of the catalytic hexamer . The B^H subunit^I inhibitory contacts at the B^base^I of the ScV1 are mediated by a loop in HCT ( highlighted in magenta ) that is seen to contact two short segments of the C - terminal domain of the B^subunit G^I from the open catalytic site ( AB ) 1 ( highlighted in purple ) and two turns of the N - terminal a helix of the central rotor B^subunit D^I ( highlighted in B^blue^I ) . 
D HCT binds to the open ( AB ) 1 pair . View of ScV1 looking along the central rotor B^subunit D^I towards the cytoplasm , showing the position of the B^H subunit^I binding at the interface of the open A / B pair ( AB ) 1 . The catalytic hexamer is shown in surface representation and the central rotor , peripheral stalks and B^subunit H^I are shown as ribbons . 
C Growth phenotype of B^H subunit^I mutants . Deletion of V - B^ATPase^I subunits from yeast results in a conditional lethal phenotype ( Vma - ) characterized by an inability to B^grow^I at pH 7 . 5 in the presence of 60 mM CaCl2 ( upper panel ) , but growth is observed at pH 5 ( lower panel ) . B^Subunit H^I mutations were introduced on a plasmid into a yeast strain deleted for the B^H subunit^I and their phenotypes assessed . Both human B^H subunit^I isoforms ( HsH1 , HsH2 ) , a chimeric B^H subunit^I ( HChim ) containing ScHNT and HsHCT , mutations in yeast intended to mimic the length of the human H loop sequence and accessibility ( Hloop ) , and a point mutation of the conserved aspartic B^acid^I residue in the loop sequence ( HD410A ) are shown compared to the B^H subunit^I deletion ( ΔH ) and wild type H on a plasmid ( H WTpl ) . All B^grow^I on pH 5 medium , but the human isoforms failed to complement the deletion phenotype . 
D B^ATPase^I activity of B^H subunit^I mutants . The ScV1 sectors were purified from each strain that complemented the phenotype as well as from ScV1ΔH , for comparison of MgATPase activity . Average specific activities are shown plotted + / - s . e . m from two independent purifications . The ScV1 sector containing chromosomally encoded B^H subunit^I shows no detectable MgATPase activity ( Parra et al , 2000 ; Zhang et al , 2003 ) , whereas ScV1containing plasmid - borne wild type H ( H WTpl ) exhibits low levels of activity likely due to reduced expression from the low B^copy^I plasmid . The HChim and HLoop mutants lead to a loss of activity silencing , displaying nearly the same activity as ScV1ΔH . 
E SDS - PAGE and Western B^Blot^I analysis of ScV1 preparations . Left panel , 15 % SDS PAGE of ScV1 purified from the B^subunit H^I mutant and WT strains . Note that H WTch is purified from a yeast strain deleted for the B^C subunit^I ( used for crystallization ) . The remaining strains contain B^subunit C^I , which is co - purified B^with^I ScV1 in varying levels . Note that while H WTch ScV1 , which is expressed from a strain deleted for B^subunit C^I , displays no detectable MgATPase activity , the B^H subunit^I mutants co - purified B^with^I the most B^C subunit^I display the least activity , suggesting that absence or presence of B^subunit C^I has no effect on MgATPase activity . Right panel , immunoblot probed B^with^I an antibody directed against the N - terminal Myc tagged mutant B^H subunits^I expressed from a plasmid . Note that the levels of mutant H expression does not appear to vary from strain to strain . 
A Overlay of ScV1 and the cryo - EM structure of the V1Vo holoenzyme in " state 2 " ( Zhao et al , 2015 ) . The structures of ScV1 and ScV1Vo were overlaid by aligning the A3B3 catalytic hexamers , thus highlighting structural differences in the central rotor and peripheral stator subunits . Coloring of ScV1Vo ( shown as semi - transparent ribbons ) is as used throughout for ScV1 for all but the A3B3F ( tan ) , B^subunit H^I ( B^dark^I green ) , B^subunit C^I and Vo domain ( gray ) . The EG1 - HNT interaction is boxed . Note the shift in position of HNT and EG1 between ScV1 and ScV1Vo . 
B Comparison of peripheral stalk EG1 and HNT in ScV1 versus ScV1Vo . The boxed view in A is shown enlarged . The N - terminal α helices of peripheral stalk EG1 and HNT change in conformation , likely induced by the movement of HCT when going from the holo enzyme to the autoinhibited conformation . 
C View as in A rotated 150º around the vertical . Comparisons of peripheral stalk EG3 and HCT are boxed . D Comparison of peripheral stalk EG3 in ScV1 versus ScV1Vo . In ScV1Vo , EG3 binds to the B^C subunit^I head domain ( Chead ; gray ) whereas in ScV1 , EG3 is bent towards the C - terminal domain of a catalytic B^A subunit^I ( enlarged view of box labeled EG3 in panel C ) . E Comparison of HCT ' s conformation in ScV1 versus ScV1Vo . Enlarged view of box labeled HCT in panel C highlighting the conformational changes and binding interactions of HCT ; for clarity only aNT , HCT and the central rotor ( DF ) are shown . In ScV1Vo , the most C - terminal α helix ( B^dark^I green ) of HCT ( green ) binds to aNT ( B^light^I gray ) , B^with^I the inhibitory loop ( green spheres ) rotated away and inaccessible for binding the B^B subunit^I and the central stalk ( transparent red ) . In ScV1 , the HCT ( yellow ) inhibitory loop ( yellow spheres ) binds to the central stalk B^subunit D^I ( red ) and the B^B subunit^I of the open ( AB ) 1 catalytic site . The difference in conformation between ScV1Vo and ScV1 involves a ~ 150° rotation of HCT . Note that the HCT loop ( spheres ) is rotated away from the central stalk in ScV1Vo whereas in ScV1 , the C - terminal α helix ( orange ) involved in binding aNT is rotated away and unavailable for rebinding to the B^membrane^I . 
F HCT conformational changes . Available B^subunit H^I structures as obtained for isolated H ( Sagermann et al , 2001 ) ( purple ) , in ScV1Vo ( Zhao et al , 2015 ) ( green ) and in ScV1 ( yellow ) are shown aligned by their N - terminal domains ( HNT ) illustrating the conformational flexibility of HCT . The loop involved in inhibition of ScV1 is shown as red spheres , highlighting the 180º rotation of HCT when going from the conformation of isolated H ( HCT 1ho8 ) to the inhibitory conformation in ScV1 ( HCT ScV1 ) .

 ( B ) Structure of FRH from the B^large^I crystallographic cell B^with^I an accordingly colored domain map below . 
 ( A ) FRH B^large^I cell ( B^cyan^I ) , B^Mtr4^I ( pdb 2XGJ , green , RNA backbone in orange ) , and FRH small alternate cell ( B^blue^I ) differ primarily in the orientation of the B^arch^I domain . The FRH RNA - bound structure also crystallizes in the small - cell configuration . The two different FRH structures have an overall RMSD of 3 . 9 Å and the RMSD between B^Mtr4^I and FRH is 2 . 9 Å ( over 734 residues , for B^large^I cell FRH ) . 
 ( B ) SAXS data indicates that FRH - Δ114 is monomeric and flexible . The crystal structure of the B^large^I cell structure predicts the solution scattering curve ( left , χ2 = 0 . 92 ) and fits well to the calculated molecular envelope ( right ) . 
 ( A ) Comparison of the FRH N - terminus ( B^large^I cell structure , magenta ) to that of B^Mtr4^I ( green ) aligned on their B^RecA^I domains . Only the additional elements of FRH are shown ( B^cyan^I ) . The FRH N - terminal extension has little ordered secondary structure , although regions 143 - 147 and 129 - 135 form small turns that interact B^with^I the B^helicase^I B^core^I . ( B ) The very N - terminus of FRH extends away from the B^RecA^I - 2 domain to interact B^with^I a symmetry related molecule in the crystal ( below ) , whereas the B^Mtr4^I N - terminus turns back to form an outer β−strand . Center panel shows the crystal contacts , B^with^I close - ups for each region highlighted as insets on the left and right . 
 ( A ) The two B^RecA^I domains are rotated relative to one another in FRH ( B^cyan^I , B^large^I cell ) compared to B^Mtr4^I ( green , RNA backbone in orange ) . The change in positioning of B^RecA^I - 2 B^with^I respect to B^RecA^I - 1 results in an overall displacement from the B^Mtr4^I domain juxtaposition that ranges from 1 . 1 - 4 . 0 Å throughout B^RecA^I - 2 B^with^I the largest differences at the external helices .

Quantification of the β ' - COP VN• B^Dsl3p^I VC BiFC signals in wild type cells and in B^COPI^I binding - deficient B^dsl1^I - 5xWA and B^dsl1^I - Δlasso mutants ( as shown exemplarily in ( B ) ) . Mean values + SEM of at least three independent experiments ( n = 3 - 8 ) are displayed . Statistical analysis was carried out by comparing the number of cells B^with^I BiFC signals over integrated thresholds to those without signals ( * = p < 0 , 05 ) . B^dsl1^I mutant strains show a significant decrease in brightness , B^spot^I number and B^spot^I B^size^I in comparison B^with^I their corresponding B^DSL1^I wild type strains ( two - sample t - B^test^I ) . The B^dsl1^I - 5xWA mutation also led to comparable signal reduction in cells carrying the VNI152L variant in the β ' - COP VN I152L• B^Dsl3p^I VC combination .

G . BiFC signal quantifications of the strains presented in ( F ) . β ' - COP VN yielded BiFC fluorescence signals B^with^I all tested complementation partners . B^This^I rules out the possibility that the B^lack^I of suppression observed in F simply reflects the inability of the BiFC partners to form a complex , and shows that the successful complementation of the split - YFP fragments does not per se suppress the synthetic lethal effect of the VN tag in B^dsl1^I - 5xWA cells . Mean values + SEM of at least three independent experiments ( n = 3 - 8 ) are displayed .

B^Time^I - lapse images of agarose - embedded cells carrying the COPI•Dsl BiFC pair βʼ - COP VN• B^Dsl3p^I VC or the COPI•COPI BiFC pair βʼ - COP VN• α - COP VC were recorded at RT B^with^I continuous PM Glc + ura medium supply at 5 min intervals . Single cell pseudokymographs were generated by concatenating the central section of the cell ( sliced along the B^pole^I axis , frames at B^double^I the width of the bud neck ) of a B^time^I - lapse dataset . The COPI•Dsl strain showed one single dominant B^spot^I at the bud tip and later the bud neck .

B^Time^I - lapse images of agarose - embedded cells carrying the β ' - COP VN• B^Dsl3p^I VC BiFC pair were recorded at RT B^with^I PM Glc + ura medium supply at 2 min intervals . Fluorescence of ROIs marked in dashed lines ( where the B^full^I cell , B^full^I bud , or only the bud foci were bleached ) were depleted by three repetitions of fluorescence excitation at 177 µs / pixel and 100 % laser intensity . Arrowheads : reappearing fluorescence signal ; scale bar 2 µm . G . Densitometric measurements of fluorescence intensities in photobleached cells . Representative data sets from five independent experiments are displayed , featuring cells that had been bleached entirely ( B^black^I lines ) , at the bud only ( B^dark^I B^blue^I lines ) , or at the fluorescent foci at the bud tip only ( B^light^I B^blue^I B^line^I ) . Values are displayed in percentage of initial fluorescence , and were corrected for photobleaching effects by normalization against fluorescence of unbleached cells . Fluorescence recovery was typically not continued to B^full^I recovery stage because of the photobleaching artefacts occurring during long - B^term^I imaging of the samples . 
Time - lapse micrographs of agarose - embedded cells were taken at RT B^with^I fresh PM Glc + ura medium supply throughout one budding cycle . Representative images of characteristically reoccurring fluorescence localization stages are displayed .

Strikingly , the fatty tissue is located in the internal parts of almost all the affected muscles in thigh ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 - 9 ) , while the external regions are spared . At calf level , only the gastrocnemius medialis muscle ( 12 ) shows B^this^I pattern , while the soleus ( 13 ) is diffusely involved . Patient II . 2 ( PII . 2 ) shows B^late^I - stage thigh muscles B^with^I an unusual involvement of the tibialis posteriormuscle ( 14 ) in the lower leg . 
A Muscle sections show variable labeling using an antibody against glycosylated α - B^dystroglycan^I ( αDG - IIH6 ) , whereas labeling using antibodies against α - B^dystroglycan^I B^core protein^I ( αDG - B^Core^I ) , β - B^dystroglycan^I ( B^βDG^I ) and B^laminin^I - 2 is similar to control ( Scale bar , 100 μm ) .

In muscle , expression of αDG - IIH6 is reduced but the αDG - B^Core^I shows similar expression as controls , B^with^I a slight reduction in molecular weight ; B^laminin^I overlay assay detected some binding activity but was diminished compared to controls , whereas B^agrin^I - binding activity showed no difference B^with^I controls . In fibroblasts , both αDG - IIH6 and αDG - B^Core^I expression and B^laminin^I - binding activity were normal , suggesting that unlike other muscular dystrophies , α - B^dystroglycan^I glycosylation defect is muscle - specific in B^POGLUT1^I patients . 
C No ultrastructural alterations are observed in muscle by electron microscopy ( 6 - 7 fields were captured from PII . 1 , PII . 3 , and PII . 5 ) . Note normal basement B^membrane^I compactation ( arrowheads ) . Original magnification : 26 , 700 . 
A B^Protein O^I - glucosyltransferase activity of wild - type ( WT ) or D233E mutant B^POGLUT1^I protein toward human factor IX EGF repeat ( B^hFIX^I - EGF ) . Wild - type shows higher O - glucosyltransferase activity than D233E , and B^this^I activity is dependent on the concentration of the acceptor substrate B^hFIX^I - EGF repeat ( left ) and on the concentration of donor substrate UDP - glucose ( UDP - Glc ) ( right ) . Values indicate mean ± SEM from three independent assays . 
B O - glucosyltransferase activity towards five different single EGF repeats from mouse B^Notch1^I . Wild - type B^POGLUT1^I shows higher activity toward all EGF repeats tested than B^POGLUT1^I D233E . The Y - axis shows the normalized activity relative to wild - type B^POGLUT1^I . EGF repeats were at 10 μM . Values indicate mean ± SEM from three independent assays . 
C Elution profiles of the B^POGLUT1^I reaction products on reverse phase HPLC . B^hFIX^I - EGF repeat was incubated B^with^I wild - type or D233E mutant B^POGLUT1^I and donor substrate , UDP - Glc or UDP - xylose ( UDP - Xyl ) , at 37ºC overnight . Values on top of the peaks indicate the measured masses . Addition of Glc ( 162 Da ) or xylose ( 132 Da ) to B^hFIX^I - EGF ( 5696 . 2 Da ) by wild - type B^POGLUT1^I caused a shift to an earlier retention B^time^I ( left ) . Similarly , the products exhibited a similar shift after incubation B^with^I B^POGLUT1^I D233E ( right ) . These results indicate that B^POGLUT1^I D233E can add a single glucose or xylose to B^hFIX^I - EGF repeats and thus has residual enzymatic activity .

A - A " Staining of Drosophila indirect flight muscles at 25 % pupal development B^with^I 22C10 antibody ( myotube marker ) and anti - B^Twist^I antibody ( myoblast marker ) indicates that in wild - type animals , indirect flight muscles are formed from 6 myotubes , and a B^large^I number of B^Twist^I + myoblasts are present . B - B " B^rumi^I 79 / 79 mutants raised at 18C show no obvious defects in myoblast number or myotube morphology . C - D " B^rumi^I 79 / 79 mutants exhibit decreased number of myoblasts at 25° - 30 °C and either an incomplete set of short myotubes when raised at 25C or aberrant morphology of myotubes when raised at 30C . E - E " B^rumi^I 79 / 79 animals overexpressing B^FLAG^I - tagged B^POGLUT1^I WT in the muscle compartment using B^Mef2^I - B^GAL4^I and raised at 25C during the pupal stage show a rescue of the B^rumi^I 79 / 79 muscle phenotype . F - G " Overexpression of B^FLAG^I - tagged B^POGLUT1^I D233E only partially rescues the B^rumi^I 79 / 79 muscle phenotype , B^with^I some variation in the myotube length and the number of restored B^Twist^I + cells ( compare G and F ) . Note that the number of B^Twist^I + cells restored by B^POGLUT1^I D233E is much smaller than that restored by B^POGLUT1^I WT . Scale bar in A ' is 50 µm and applies to A - G " . H Quantification of myotube lengths in B^rumi^I 79 / 79 mutants B^with^I or without B^POGLUT1^I expression indicates a weak rescue of the phenotypes by B^POGLUT1^I D233E compared to B^POGLUT1^I WT . Mean ± standard deviation is shown . The differences in myotube lengths are statistically significant ( n = 22 - 54 ) . Mean ± standard deviation is shown ; One - way Anova B^with^I Bonferroni´s multiple comparisons B^test^I . 
A - F Proliferation assays examined proliferating ( B^PAX7^I + B^MyoD^I + , arrows ) , self - renewing ( B^PAX7^I + B^MyoD^I − , open arrows ) , and differentiating ( B^PAX7^I − B^MyoD^I + , arrowheads ) cells from D233E patients ( n = 2 ) , healthy controls ( n = 3 ) and disease controls ( n = 3 ) at 1 , 4 , and 8 days growing in proliferation medium . ( A ) shows representative images from day 8 . The number of patientmyoblasts is lower than that of controls at all three B^time^I points , indicating a slower proliferation rate in patientmyoblasts ( B ) , and accordingly , the percentage of proliferating cells ( C ) is smaller in the patient . ( D ) The percentage of self - renewing cells is small in patient´s culture , reflecting a poor capacity for maintaining the pool of quiescent SCs . In addition , the percentage of B^PAX7^I + cells ( E ) is smaller in patient´s culture , similarly to what was found in adult D233E muscle ( shown in Fig 5D ) . ( F ) The percentage of differentiating cells is higher in the patient . We examine proliferation capturing 7 - 12 randomly fields per day and condition ( mean ± SEM is shown ; Kruskal - Wallis B^with^I Dunn´s multiple comparisons B^test^I ; Scale bar , 50 µm ) . 
G - I When myoblasts started to be confluent , the proliferation medium was replaced B^with^I differentiation medium , and the myoblasts started to B^fuse^I yielding myotubes , which were analyzed after four days of differentiation . ( H ) The fusion index , which measures the percentage of nuclei in myotubes B^with^I respect to the total number of nuclei in myogenic cells , was higher in D233E cultures than in controls . ( I ) Besides , B^myogenin^I showed increased expression in D233E myoblast cultures compared to controls . The data support that differentiation process is facilitated in patient´s muscle . Data was collected from 3 - 10 randomly chosen areas per condition ( mean ± SEM is shown ; Kruskal - Wallis B^with^I Dunn´s multiple comparisons B^test^I ( H ) and One - way Anova B^with^I Bonferroni´s multiple comparisons B^test^I ( I ) ; Scale bar , 50 µm ) . 
A - C We overexpressed GFP - tagged B^NICD^I in immortalized primary myoblasts to rescue the features displayed by immortalized D233E myoblasts . ( B ) We analyzed the proliferation at 1 , 3 and 5 days , and proliferation rate in patient - LV - B^NICD^I - GFP reached the level observed in control - LV - GFP , which were higher than in patient - LV - GFP . ( C ) However , the percentage of B^PAX7^I + cells in patient - LV - B^NICD^I - GFP showed the same reduced value as in patient - LV - GFP , which were significantly lower than in control - LV - GFP . The majority of control myoblasts were proliferating cells ( B^PAX7^I + B^MyoD^I + , arrows ) , B^with^I no quiescent cells and few differentiating cells detected . Data were collected from n = 2 independent assays ( 5 - 8 images per condition ) . Mean ± SEM is shown ; One - way Anova B^with^I Tukey multiple comparisions B^test^I ( B ) and Kruskal - Wallis B^with^I Dunn´s multiple comparisons B^test^I ( C ) ; Scale bar , 50 µm ) . 
D - F As previously described in patient ' s primary myoblasts , patient - LV - GFP myoblasts showed a striking facilitated differentiation compared to control - LV - GFP - myoblasts . B^This^I phenotype fully disappeared in patient - LV - GFP - B^NICD^I myoblasts , as quantification of the fusion index ( E ) , and B^myogenin^I expression ( F ) demonstrated . The data support a pathogenic role for B^Notch^I inhibition on the altered differentiation in our patients . Data were collected from n = 3 independent assays ( 13 - 17 images per condition ) . Mean ± SEM is shown ; Kruskal - Wallis B^with^I Dunn´s multiple comparisons B^test^I ; Scale bar , 50 µm ) . 
A Immortalized primary myoblasts from a healthy control showed a progressive pattern of α - B^dystroglycan^I glycosylation during five days of differentiation ( D0 - D5 ) , as has been previously described by Goddeeris et al . Immortalized primary myoblasts from patients displayed an irregular pattern of glycosylation , B^with^I a final level of glycosylated α - B^dystroglycan^I that was lower than control . 
B α - B^dystroglycan^I glycosylation of infected immortalized myoblasts from patient - LV - B^NICD^I - GFP at differentiation day 5 ( D5 ) showed a striking reduction , in B^line^I B^with^I the strong inhibition of myotubes formation and differentiation induced by B^NICD^I overexpression . α - B^dystroglycan^I in myoblasts from patient - LV - GFP showed a reduction of glycosylation compared to control - LV - GFP at D5 , similar to the results obtained in the adult muscle from patients ( Fig . 2 ) . 
C - D C2C12 myogenic cells showed a reduced level of glycosylated α - B^dystroglycan^I when the B^Notch^I signaling inhibitor DAPT or LY3039478 was added to the differentiation medium . B^This^I indicates that reducing B^Notch^I signaling can affect α - B^dystroglycan^I glycosylation in wild - type C2C12 myoblasts cells , which do not harbor any known mutations in α - B^dystroglycan^I glycosyltransferases or B^Poglut1^I . 
E - F qRT - PCR experiments show that upon DAPT or LY3039478 treatment , a remarkable decrease in B^Hes1^I mRNA is induced in C2C12 cells during differentiation .

Circles indicate speckles showing directional movement over a distance of several micrometers . Trajectories of these speckles are also illustrated , and crosses were plotted at the end of the directional movement . Speckles showing directional movement were frequently observed in cells expressing GFP - B^DIA1^I ( R1204X ) ( B ) , whereas such speckles were scarce in cells expressing GFP - B^DIA1^I ( WT ) ( A ) . However , the density of these speckles in GFP - B^DIA1^I ( R1204X ) - expressing cells appeared lower than that in GFP - B^DIA1^I ( M1190D ) - expressing cells , which is considered a fully active mutant ( C ) . To evaluate the frequency of speckles indicating directional movement , we performed a quantitative analysis ( D ) . The number of speckles showing directional movement during 3 continuous planes was counted and were normalized by the fluorescent intensity of each cell , which corresponds to the expression level of the GFP - tagged protein . * P = 0 . 0288 and * * P = 0 . 0002 Bonferroni ' s B^post^I hoc B^test^I following one - way ANOVA ( WT ; n = 5 , R1204X ; n = 6 , M1190D ; n = 6 ) .

We define " relative indentation " as the change in C - terminus ( B^Nyv1^I ) - C - terminus ( B^Vam3^I ) distance that occurs when the SNARE complex performs mechanical work . It reflects the depth of the formed well upon squeezing . The slope of the obtained work profile estimates the required force ( B^thin^I B^black^I B^line^I ) . Perforation ( red arrow ) requires a force of 80 pN for the wild - type C - termini . The plateau within the work profile indicates that the B^membrane^I gives up its elastic response ( perforation transition ) . C - terminal tags oppose such a perforation transition but do not significantly affect the forces observed within the indentation regime . Furthermore , if the unstructured peptide - spacer would be B^alpha^I - helical - and thus much shorter - indentation forces would still be only slightly affected .

 ( A ) Chromosome 7 of S . bayanus is incompatible B^with^I the S . cerevisiae genome . The chromosome 7 replacement stain ( Sc + Sb - chr7 ) exhibited serious growth defects when grown on the non - fermentable carbon source ( glycerol ) . The respiration defects could be partially rescued when a whole set of S . bayanus chromosomes were provided ( Sc + Sb - chr7 x Sb - ρ⁰ ) , or fully rescued B^with^I the addition of S . bayanus mtDNA ( Sc + Sb - chr7 - ρ⁰ x Sb ) . Cell cultures were serially - diluted and spotted onto YPD ( glucose ) or YPG ( glycerol ) plates . The plates were then incubated at 28 °C until colonies were easily observed . Sc , S . cerevisiae . Sb , S . bayanus . ρ⁰ , mtDNA - less strains . 
 ( B ) Ectopically - expressing Sc - B^CCM1^I rescues the respiration defect of Sc + Sb - chr7 . B^Spot^I assays for the wild - type S . cerevisiae ( Sc ) and the chromosome 7 replacement stain ( Sc + Sb - chr7 ) carrying an empty plasmid ( + vector ) or the plasmid B^with^I the S . cerevisiae B^CCM1^I gene ( + Sc - B^CCM1^I ) . 
 ( C ) Sb - B^CCM1^I incompatibility could only be rescued in the presence of S . bayanus mtDNA . The native B^CCM1^I ORF in S . cerevisiae was replaced by either Sb - B^CCM1^I ( Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I ) or Sc - B^CCM1^I ( Sc + Sc - B^CCM1^I , as a control ) coding regions . Crossing the Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I strain B^with^I the mtDNA - less Sb - ρ⁰ strain ( Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I x Sb - ρ⁰ ) could not rescue the growth defect . 
 ( D ) B^CCM1^I incompatibility is symmetric between S . cerevisiae and S . bayanus . The B^CCM1^I ORF in S . bayanus was replaced by either Sc - B^CCM1^I ( Sb + Sc - B^CCM1^I ) or Sb - B^CCM1^I ( Sb + Sb - B^CCM1^I , as a control ) coding regions . Only the Sb + Sc - B^CCM1^I strain exhibited respiration defects and the defect could not be rescued even when a whole set of S . cerevisiae chromosomes were provided ( Sb + Sc - B^CCM1^I x Sc - ρ⁰ ) . 
 ( E ) B^CCM1^I incompatibility probably occurred during the divergence between S . bayanus and the common ancestor of S . cerevisiae , S . paradoxus , S . mikatae and S . kudriavzevii . The endogenous B^CCM1^I in S . cerevisiae was replaced B^with^I its orthologous alleles from other Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts . Only the strain carrying S . bayanus B^CCM1^I displayed growth defects on glycerol - containing plates . 
 ( A ) Sb - B^Ccm1^I protein is transported efficiently to S . cerevisiae mitochondria . Total cell extracts ( total ) , cytosolic fractions ( cyto ) or mitochondrial fractions ( B^mito^I ) were hybridized B^with^I different antibodies to detect the proteins . B^G6PDH^I ( glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ) and B^Cox2^I served as cytosolic and mitochondrial markers , respectively . Both Sc - B^Ccm1^I and Sb - B^Ccm1^I were fused B^with^I c - Myc at the C - terminus and expressed from a single - B^copy^I plasmid . The Myc - tagged B^Ccm1^I proteins consistently appeared as B^double^I bands , which were probably due to some B^unknown protein^I modifications . 
 ( B ) The level of B^15S rRNA^I is reduced in Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I cells . RNA isolated from Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I ( labeled as Sb ) or Sc + Sc - B^CCM1^I ( labeled as Sc ) cells was hybridized B^with^I gene - specific probes using Northern blots . 
 ( C ) Sb - B^Ccm1^I interacts weakly B^with^I S . cerevisiae B^15S rRNA^I . The level of B^Ccm1^I - bound B^15S rRNA^I was measured using quantitative PCR analysis following mitochondrial RNA immunoprecipitation of S . cerevisiae cells expressing Sc - B^CCM1^I - 13Myc or Sb - B^CCM1^I - 13 Myc . Data was normalized to the control group without the Myc tag to obtain the relative B^fold^I enrichment . Graph was plotted using data from three independent repeats for each strain and p value was calculated by unpaired , two - sided student t - B^test^I . Error bars indicate S . D . * * * , p value < 0 . 001 . 
 ( D ) Overexpressing Sb - B^CCM1^I rescues the respiration defect of Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I cells . Cell cultures were serially - diluted and spotted onto YPD ( glucose ) or YPG ( glycerol ) plates . The plates were then incubated at 28 °C until colonies were easily observed . 
 ( E ) The steady - state level of mtDNA - encoded proteins is reduced in Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I cells . Immunoblotting for the mitochondrial proteins in Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I ( labeled as Sb ) or Sc + Sc - B^CCM1^I ( labeled as Sc ) cells . B^Cox1^I , B^Cox2^I and B^Cox3^I are mtDNA - encoded complex IV subunits . B^Tom20^I is a nucleus - encoded mitochondrial protein . 
 ( A ) Tetrad analysis reveals that the respiration defect of Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I cells can be rescued by mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear genomes . The suppressor clones were crossed B^with^I the Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I - ρ⁰ strain and the tetrads from the cross were analyzed . A non - Mendelian 4 : 0 segregation pattern for improved respiration is expected if the suppressor mutation is in mtDNA ( left panel ) . Otherwise , a 2 : 2 segregation pattern would be observed if the rescue effect involved a single nuclear mutation ( right panel ) . 
 ( A ) Reconstituted Sb - B^CCM1^I mutants can rescue the incompatibility of Sb - B^CCM1^I . Among 94 suppressor clones , 20 of B^them^I carry mutations in the Sb - B^CCM1^I gene . These mutants were reconstructed in Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I cells to B^test^I their function . Superscripts next to Sb - B^CCM1^I indicate the respective amino B^acid^I substitutions and numbers in parentheses indicate the number of independent clones in our suppressor screen . Sc , wild - type S . cerevisiae . 
 ( C ) The 400th residue plays a determinant role in the S . cerevisiae - S . bayanus incompatibility . Both Sb - B^CCM1^I E375Q and Sb - B^CCM1^I D400N mutants relieved the incompatibility in S . cerevisiae , but only Sb - B^CCM1^I D400N caused respiration defects in S . bayanus . The Sb - B^CCM1^I E375Q mutant was selected as a control in B^this^I experiment since it was a charged - to - polar substitution similar to Sb - B^CCM1^I D400N and also appeared three times in our screen . Sb , wild - type S . bayanus . 
 ( D ) Protein structural analysis shows that all intramolecular suppressor mutations were located on the predicted PPR motifs . The predicted protein structure of B^Ccm1^I is shown at left . B^Blue^I and green colors indicate the two α - helices in each predicted PPR motif and B^white^I color indicates additional α - helices in the N - terminus and the middle region . Red color indicates the positions of the suppressor mutations . Predicted PPR motifs occupy around 52 % of the whole protein ( 453 of 871 residues ) . The box at right displays a magnified version of some PPR motifs where the substitutions are located . 
 ( A ) B^15S rRNA^I levels are increased in the suppressor clones . Total RNA was isolated from the replacement strains ( Sc + Sc - B^CCM1^I and Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I ) , two nuclear suppressor strains ( Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I D400N and Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I E375Q ) and one mitochondrial suppressor strain and then subjected to quantitative PCR analyses . Relative mRNA abundance was calculated by normalizing the B^15S rRNA^I level to the B^ATP6^I mRNA level . Graph was plotted using data from five independent repeats for each strain and p values were calculated by unpaired , two - sided student t - B^test^I . Error bars indicate S . D . * * * , p value < 0 . 001 . * * , p value < 0 . 01 . Asterisks in B^black^I , comparing Sc + Sc - B^CCM1^I B^with^I others . Asterisks in gray , comparing Sc + Sb - B^CCM1^I B^with^I others . 
 ( B ) The steady - state level of mtDNA - encoded proteins is increased in the suppressor clones . Protein extracts from the replacement and suppressor strains were hybridized B^with^I antibodies against B^G6PDH^I , B^Cox1^I , B^Cox2^I or B^Cox3^I . 
 ( B ) Seven of 12 tested PPR genes exhibit incompatibility between S . cerevisiae and at least one other Saccharomyces sensu stricto species . The doubling B^time^I of S . cerevisiae cells carrying the endogenous PPR genes ( Sc ) or orthologs of other yeast species ( Sp , Sm , Sk and Sb ) were measured in YPD ( glucose ) or YPG ( glycerol ) media . All the measurements were then normalized to the doubling B^time^I of Sc to obtain the relative doubling B^time^I .

Furthermore , compounds differ in their P2 residue ( either methoxytyrosine or tryptophane ; B^blue^I ) . Inhibitor 9 , also termed LU - 015i , is endowed B^with^I an exceptional cyclohexyl residue ( gray ) , which is associated B^with^I increased selectivity for human B^β5i^I . 
A . Inhibition of human B^β5c^I and B^β5i^I by ONX 0914 and PR - 924 . IC50 values are deduced from the fitted data . 
E . Serial dilutions of yeast cells were spotted on YPD plates and grown for 2 days either at 30 °C or 37 °C . Mutant yeasts are significantly retarded in growth and show increased temperature sensitivity . 
F . Surface illustration of the yCP . The β5 and β6 subunits are depicted in B^dark^I gray , B^with^I the residue ranges that correspond to mammalian β5 and β6 subunits in the chimeric proteasomes highlighted in gold and B^blue^I , respectively . The β5 ' and β6 ' subunits of the second β - B^ring^I are hidden on the back of 20S proteasome . 
A . Superposition of the B^β5i^I / β6 active sites of genuine mouse iCP and the B^hβ5i^I / B^hβ6^I human / yeast chimera illustrates that Met45 adopts the same ' open ' conformation in both structures . Amino B^acid^I B^side^I chains important for substrate binding are depicted as sticks . The catalytic B^Thr1^I is colored in B^black^I . B^Met31^I , the single amino B^acid^I difference between mouse and human B^β5i^I active sites , is highlighted in green .

D . Superposition of the B^hβ5c^I / B^hβ6^I and the B^hβ5i^I / B^hβ6^I chimeric proteasomes confirm the distinct positions of Met45 analogously to the natural mouse subunits shown in panel C . 
A . Complex structures of the human B^β5c^I / β6 ( left ) and B^β5i^I / β6 ( right ) chimeric proteasomes B^with^I PR - 924 . The ligand binds in a linear ( l ) manner to the B^β5c^I / β6 substrate binding channel , but in a kinked ( k ) conformation to the B^β5i^I / β6 active site . The 2FO - FC electron density maps for the ligands bound to B^Thr1^I of the chimeric β5 active sites are shown as B^blue^I meshes contoured at 1σ . The inhibitor and B^Thr1^I have been omitted for phasing . 
B . Comparison of the conformations of ONX 0914 , PR - 924 , 14 , 16 , 17 and 18 bound to the chimeric B^hβ5^I / B^hβ6^I substrate binding channels . The l amino B^acid^I compounds ONX 0914 and 14 display a linear ( l ) binding B^mode^I to the B^hβ5c^I / B^hβ6^I ( left ) and the B^hβ5i^I / B^hβ6^I ( right ) chimeras , whereas the ligands 16 and 17 ( P3 - d - Ala and morpholine cap ) adopt a kinked ( k ) conformation in both β5 substrate binding channels . Remarkably , the orientation of PR - 924 and its analogue 18 ( P3 - d - Ala and 3 - methyl - 1H - indene cap ) in the B^hβ5c^I / B^hβ6^I chimera ( and in WT B^yβ5^I ; see Appendix Figure S5 ) ) differs from that observed B^with^I the B^hβ5i^I / B^hβ6^I chimera . Note that the inhibitors are rotated by about 45 ° compared to panel A . 
A . Complex structures of the mouse chimeric proteasome ( left ) and the B^hβ5i^I - V31M / B^hβ6^I mutant ( right ) B^with^I PR - 924 visualize the kinked ( k ) orientation . The 2FO - FC electron density maps for the ligands bound to B^Thr1^I of the chimeric β5 active sites are depicted according to Fig 5A .

B . Superposition of inhibitors bound to the mouse chimeric proteasome ( left ) and the B^hβ5i^I - V31M / B^hβ6^I mutant ( right ) . Compounds display the same binding modes ( kinked ( k ) or linear ( l ) ) to the B^mβ5i^I / B^mβ6^I active site as to the corresponding human B^β5i^I / β6 subunit ( Fig . 5 ) and to the B^hβ5i^I - V31M / B^hβ6^I mutant . Note that the inhibitors are rotated by about 45° compared to panel A . 
C . Superposition of chimeric mammalian and WT yeast β5 active sites bound to the P3 - d - Ala compounds PR - 924 and 18 . The nucleophilic B^Thr1^I is depicted as well as the S1 pocket forming residues 31 and 45 . Residue 31 impacts on the position of the 3 - methyl - 1H - indene cap of PR - 924 and 18 . Due to steric hindrance , the N - cap is shifted in the mouse and in the B^hβ5i^I - V31M / B^hβ6^I chimera compared to the B^hβ5i^I / B^hβ6^I mutant proteasome crystal structures ( B^black^I B^double^I arrow ) . Note that the structures are rotated by 90° compared to panel B . 
ONX 0914 binds in a linear B^mode^I to all active sites . Changing the stereochemistry at the P3 site from l - Ala ( S ) to d - Ala ( R ) leads to a kinked conformation in the β5 substrate binding channels ( compound 16 ) . Substitution of the morpholine cap of 16 by a larger 3 - metyhl - 1H - indene moiety yields PR - 924 and results in different inhibitor conformations at the B^yβ5^I / B^hβ5c^I and the mammalian B^β5i^I active sites . Hereby , the selectivity for B^hβ5i^I over B^hβ5c^I is drastically increased ( IC50 ratio B^hβ5c^I / B^hβ5i^I : 255 ) compared to ONX 0914 ( IC50 ratio B^hβ5c^I / B^hβ5i^I : 20 ) and compound 16 ( IC50 ratio B^hβ5c^I / B^hβ5i^I : 5 . 2 , Fig 2 ) . Residue B^Met31^I of B^mβ5i^I sterically hinders the kinked binding B^mode^I of PR - 924 , thereby creating 7 - B^fold^I selectivity for human B^β5i^I .

D . B^FACS^I based mitophagy flux analysis performed in B^HeLa^I cell B^line^I stably expressing HA - B^Parkin^I , mt - B^mKeima^I , and a GFP fusion of the indicated sensor . Cells were treated B^with^I OAQ ( oligomycin , antimycin , Q - VD ) for indicated times and analyzed by B^FACS^I for lysosomal - positive mt - B^mKeima^I ( 561nm ) . The average of three independent experiments is presented . Representative B^FACS^I data from experiments ( GFP control and AS3 _ 67 ) are shown in the lower panels . Error bars indicate standard deviation . Significance calculation : 2 - way anova of one - way anova . n . s . = not significant . * * * indicates p - value of 0 . 0001 . 
A . B^LC3C^I specific sensor mCh - AS3 _ 67 is recruited to Salmonella ( SFH2 ) escaping SCV . Salmonella SFH2 strain is carrying a GFP - reporter gene activated by availability of glucose - 6 - phosphate in the host ' s cytosol . 
B . Salmonella B^with^I prolonged cytosolic residence and strong activation of the GFP - reporter gene ( green arrow ) are not recognized by the B^LC3C^I specific sensor mCh - AS3 _ 67 . 
C . A subpopulation of hyper proliferative Salmonella in the cytosol is coated B^with^I endogenous B^LC3C^I . In contrast , endogenous B^LC3B^I is enriched in spots in close proximity to the cytosolic bacteria . 
D . Sensitivity of B^LC3C^I specific sensor mCh - AS3 _ 67 is increased upon fusion of B^membrane^I - tethering B^FYVE^I domain or PB1 oligomerization domain . 
E . Introduction of the PB1 domain to mCh - AS3 _ p62 increases its performance in recognizing endogenous B^LC3B^I . 
F . High - performance sensor mCh - PB1 - AS3 _ 67 was transiently expressed in Salmonella infected B^HeLa^I cells to monitor xenophagy events . 
A , B . B^LC3C^I specific sensor mCh - PB1 - AS3 _ 67 is recruited to a subset of mitochondria undergoing mitophagy . Mitochondria were labeled B^with^I MitoTracker Deep Red ( ThermoFisher ) . U2OS cells were transiently co - transfected for indicated sensor and mATG8 proteins . Mitophagy was induced by CCCP treatment over three hours . Lysosomal degradation of mitochondria undergoing mitophagy was blocked by the addition of BafilomycinA1 ( Baf ) . 
C . Upon depolarization , endogenous B^LC3C^I is localized to mitochondria labeled B^with^I mt - B^mCherry^I in U2OS cells . An example of rare events B^with^I nearly complete overlap of signals for endogenous B^LC3C^I and mitochondria ( upper panel ) and a representative image ( lower panel ) is given . 
D . Overlap of B^LC3C^I specific sensor signal B^with^I endogenous B^LC3C^I and endogenous B^LAMP1^I in U2OS cells induced for mitophagy .
